# Loan application outcome prediction

## About the data set
The file in `./data/loan_data.csv` contains old data on 1000 loan applications
in Germany (which is why the currency is in Deutsche
Mark, or DM). The target `accepted` shows whether the application was accepted
or rejected, with the following encoding:
- 2 = accepted;
- 1 = rejected.
